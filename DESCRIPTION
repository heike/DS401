Description: When topographic scans are taken under Confocal Light Microscopes 
    even small differences in settings can have a large impact on the acquired
    data. This package implements a set of features assessing the quality of a 
    scan by investigating the structure where the scan has missing values.
    These features are used as training data in two random forests that predict
    the quality of scans, and if found lacking, also predict the reason for its
    lack of quality.
