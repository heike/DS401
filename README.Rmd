The goal of the DS401 R package is to assess quality of 3d topographics scans in form of x3p images. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of DS401 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("heike/DS401")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(DS401)
## basic example code
library(x3ptools)
```

### This scan has a lot of problems

```{r}
x3p_image(fau277_bb_l2, file = "man/figures/fau277_bb_l2.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/fau277_bb_l2.png")
```

### This scan is about as good as we can hope for

```{r}
x3p_image(fau001_ba_l1, file = "man/figures/fau001_ba_l1.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/fau001_ba_l1.png")
```


The `DS401` package combines a set of functions assessing the quality of scans.

### Feature extracted

`extract_na` calculates the percentage of values that are missing in the surface matrix of the scan. For the scan showns above, the percentages are quite high for the bad scan and low for the good scan:

```{r}
extract_na(fau277_bb_l2)
extract_na(fau001_ba_l1)
```

### Row and column-wise missing values

Document use of functions `extract_na_column` and `extract_na_row` for both a good and a bad plot. 

```{r}
nas_bad <- extract_na_column(fau277_bb_l2) # this scan has a particularly high percentage of missing values
nas_good <- extract_na_column(fau001_ba_l1) # good scan
plot((1:length(nas_good))*3, nas_good, col =2) # similar pattern to above, but low values for most of the scan
points(nas_bad, col=4)
```



```{r}
nas_bad <- extract_na_row(fau277_bb_l2) # this scan has a particularly high percentage of missing values
nas_good <- extract_na_row(fau001_ba_l1) # good scan

plot(nas_bad, col=4)
points((1:length(nas_good))*3, nas_good, col =2) # similar pattern to above, but low values for most of the scan
```




### col_na Function

The col_na function's goal is to distinguish between good and bad scans based on the proportion of columns with large proportions of missing values. It takes in three parameters, which are an x3p object, a percentage to be used as the number acceptable percentage of missing values in a column, and the proportion that bad columns that is the threshold for a good scan.

```{r}
assess_col_na(fau277_bb_l2)
assess_col_na(fau001_ba_l1)
```

### Assess Median NA Proportion

'assess_median_na_proportion' calculates the median proportion of NA values present in the middle of a 3d scan from a specific number of different y values. Specifically this variable is calculating the amount of feathering occuring in the 3d scans.  
```{r}
assess_median_na_proportion(fau277_bb_l2)# This scan seems to have a problem with feathering
assess_median_na_proportion(fau001_ba_l1)# good scan
```

### Assess Bottom Empty

```{r}
assess_bottomempty(fau277_bb_l2)
```

### Assess Middle NA Proportion

```{r}
assess_middle_na_proportion(fau277_bb_l2)
```

### Assess Percentile NA Proportion

```{r}
assess_percentile_na_proportion(fau227_bb_l2)
```

### Assess Rotation

```{r}
assess_rotation(fau227_bb_l2)
```

### Extract Median NA Proportion

```{r}
extract_median_na_proportion(fau227_bb_l2)
```

### Extract NA

```{r}
extract_na(fau227_bb_l2)
```

### Extract NA Column

```{r}
extract_na_column(fau227_bb_l2)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
