The goal of the DS401 R package is to assess quality of 3d topographics scans in form of x3p images. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of DS401 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("heike/DS401")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(DS401)
## basic example code
library(x3ptools)
```

### This scan has a lot of problems

```{r}
x3p_image(fau277_bb_l2, file = "man/figures/fau277_bb_l2.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/fau277_bb_l2.png")
```

### This scan is about as good as we can hope for

```{r}
x3p_image(fau001_ba_l1, file = "man/figures/fau001_ba_l1.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/fau001_ba_l1.png")
```


The `DS401` package combines a set of functions assessing the quality of scans.

### Feature extracted

`extract_na` calculates the percentage of values that are missing in the surface matrix of the scan. For the scan showns above, the percentages are quite high for the bad scan and low for the good scan:

```{r}
extract_na(fau277_bb_l2)
extract_na(fau001_ba_l1)
```

### Row and column-wise missing values

Document use of functions `extract_na_column` and `extract_na_row` for both a good and a bad plot. 

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
